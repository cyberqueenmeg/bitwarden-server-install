# Bitwarden Install Script

I made this script to make it easy to install the bitwarden server, specifically on Ubuntu. Took all the commands from Docker.com and bitwarden.com.

To install, just download bitwardeninstall.sh and chmod +x to execute it. Make sure you have sudo access on the machine you run it on.
